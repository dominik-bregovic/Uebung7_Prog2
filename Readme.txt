Tryed to keep the printed output like in our given excamples but...

-The Application-class is the main class

-The output of my programm is diffrent from the musicSorted2021.csv
 Could it be that our given exmaple does not ignore lines when they have empty values at given points....
 The Interpret David Guette, for example, shouldnt be listed because at all in the musicSorted2021.csv

-I checked all dezimalpoints for interprets with the rating but could it be that you had orderd the interprets
 Descending. I hadnt't tried that because of the fact that it was not mentioned in the pdf. 
 We discussed this in class either i thought it would be negligible in this case.

-The logfile gets build in the root folder of the project.


 Thanks for your attention.
